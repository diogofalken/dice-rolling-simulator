# Dice Rolling Simulator
My first "project" in python trying to use some of the basic concepts of Python  

## Getting Started  
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.  

### Prerequisites  
You need Python 3.4 or later to run Dice Rolling Simulator. You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.  
In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:  
	```
    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
	```
### Installing
To use you just need to do this in Linux:  
	```
	$ git clone https://github.com/diogofalken/dice-rolling-simulator.git   

	$ cd dice-rolling-simulator  

	$./main.py  

	```

And you just need to follow the program.
